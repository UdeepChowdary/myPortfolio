      <p>
        I’m Udeep, a Computer Science student & developer passionate about web development and AI. I enjoy creating responsive, accessible user interfaces and building maintainable front-end architectures. I work primarily with React, JavaScript (ES6+), and CSS. When I’m not coding, I experiment with photography and fitness routines to stay creative and healthy.
